Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on in October, 2017 and finished in February, 2018. So far I've completed the first term (as of Q3 2020), and will continue the next two terms as soon as time permits. The program was deeply interesting and relevant, helping us move closer to a future with cost effective camera systems that can detect lane lines and such without LIDARS. The deep learning and computer vision application extends far beyond self-driving cars and into image classification for phones, as well as ECO cruise control systems and sustainability applications. The utility is as great as our imagination, though we should always audit our code and neural networks for biases and potential dangers. 

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended for students to learn the theroy and application of self-driving car engineers. The program was made by Udacit in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv, among others.

Program Outline:
Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision

1. Deep Learning
Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier
Project 3: Behavioural Cloning
Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network.
The Input data comprises of steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse in the simulator.

2. Computer Vision
Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines
Project 5: Vehicle Detection
